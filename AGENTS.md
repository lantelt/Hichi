# Multi-Agent System Architecture

This document outlines the roles and interactions for a Codex based multi agent
platform that automates building and deploying an eâ€‘commerce application. Each
agent runs as an independent LLM powered worker. A project manager agent
orchestrates the pipeline while agents share context through a central session
state. The system is designed to run in a Kubernetes cluster and may utilise the
Google Agent Development Kit (ADK) and Model Context Protocol (MCP) for tool
integration.

## Agents

| Name | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| Market Research | Investigate trends, competitors and customers for the requested business idea. |
| Demand Analysis | Transform research findings into a clear problem statement. |
| Requirement Definition | Propose feature requirements and a high level solution to the problem. |
| System Design | Produce the overall architecture diagram and component outline. |
| Server/Code Design | Decide frameworks, database schema and API structure. |
| Infrastructure Setup | Generate Docker/Kubernetes configuration for the environment. |
| Database Tuning | Optimise the DB schema and indexing strategy. |
| Code Generation | Generate application source code from the specifications. |
| Code Review | Review generated code and suggest fixes. |
| Test Generation | Create and execute unit tests on the new code. |
| Security Audit | Detect common vulnerabilities in code and configuration. |
| Deployment | Build and release the application to the cluster. |
| Project Management | Coordinate agents, collect results and interface with the user. |
| Solution Evaluation | Judge whether the delivered app solves the original problem. |

## Collaboration Flow

1. The user submits a request through the chat interface.
2. The project manager invokes each agent in sequence, storing outputs in the
   shared session state.
3. Some stages (for example code generation and review) may loop until the
   evaluator is satisfied.
4. Deployment occurs once tests pass and the security audit reports no critical
   issues.
5. Finally the evaluator reports success or recommends further improvements. If improvements are needed the project manager re-runs the code generation, review and testing stages before asking the evaluator again.

This design is intended as a starting point. Actual tool calls and Kubernetes
manifests would be generated by the respective agents at runtime.
