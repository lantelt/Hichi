# Interactive Coding Agent

This repository now contains an example interactive coding agent built in Python. The agent uses the OpenAI API to provide conversational coding assistance directly from the command line.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- `openai` Python package (`pip install openai`)
- An OpenAI API key set as the environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`

## Usage

Run the agent in your terminal:

```bash
python interactive_agent.py
```

Type your questions or coding requests and the assistant will respond. Enter `exit` or `quit` to end the session.

## Note

This script requires an internet connection and a valid OpenAI API key. Error handling is minimal and provided as a basic example. Feel free to expand upon it for your own use.
